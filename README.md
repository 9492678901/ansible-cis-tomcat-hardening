# Ansible role `tomcat`

An Ansible role for setting up and hardening Tomcat on RHEL/CentOS 7 or Fedora. Specifically, the responsibilities of this role are to:

- Install packages from the EPEL repository (EL7: Tomcat 7, Fedora 23: Tomcat 8)
- Manage configuration
- Harden Tomcat install

The firewall configuration is not a concern of this role. Use another role for that (e.g. [bertvv.rh-base](https://galaxy.ansible.com/bertvv/rh-base))

### Users and roles

When installing the Manager web application, you also need to define at least one user and some roles. See the [Tomcat Documentation](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/manager-howto.html#Configuring_Manager_Application_Access) for details. The following roles are available by default:

```Yaml
tomcat_roles:
  - manager-gui
  - manager-status
  - manager-script
  - manager-jmx
```

You can override these by redefining `tomcat_roles` in your `host_vars` or `group_vars`.

To enable access to the Manager web application, you must create a username/password and associate one of the `manager-xxx` roles with it. The `tomcat_users` variable takes care of this, e.g.:

```Yaml
tomcat_users:
  - name: admin
    password: 'Boavtug8'
    roles:
      - manager-gui
  - name: john
    password: 'yirphUr7'
    roles:
      - manager-jmx
```
